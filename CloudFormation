A template is a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) text file that contains the configuration information
about the AWS resources you want to create in the stack. In this particular sample template, it includes
six top-level sections: AWSTemplateFormatVersion, Description, Parameters, Mappings, Resources,
and Outputs; however, only the Resources section is required.


Let's take a look at a very basic template. The following template declares a single resource of type
AWS::S3::Bucket: with the name HelloBucket.


{
 "Resources" : {
 "HelloBucket" : {
 "Type" : "AWS::S3::Bucket"
 }
 }
}
